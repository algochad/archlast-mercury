# Release validation — 2026-09-19

Target: **v3.0.1**, released as **v3.1.0** on 2026-09-20. The 3.0.1 candidate was never published; its work shipped in 3.1.0 together with the new looks.

**What was run on the 3.1.0 sources (2026-09-20, Linux):** `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace -D warnings` clean; `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` 1,732 passed, 0 failed, 4 ignored across 102 suites (SQLite); client `tsc` clean, 2,839 unit tests in 291 files, contrast, literal-colour and static accessibility audits; 92 mocked Playwright cases; 16 real-server Playwright cases against the release binary; `client/scripts/live-drive.mjs` 25/25 against a live instance of the release binary. PostgreSQL, Windows and macOS were left to CI.

**Not repeated for 3.1.0:** the open items under "Release gates still open" below (three-instance federation, bot gateway runtime, native screen portal end to end, Windows/systemd installer branches). The table that follows records the state on 2026-09-19 and has not been re-run line by line.

Two CI failures on `main` at the time were not product defects: `release_upload_quota` set the quota in config while the seeded `server_settings` row (which outranks it) still said 5 GiB, so the test could never have limited anything; and `real-server.smoke` expected the sign-in screen after a logout on a device that now, by design, asks to unlock its identity. Two were: `WINDOWS_GRANT_VERIFIED` was referenced and never declared (Windows did not compile), and the vendored `scap` read a field that had been renamed (macOS did not compile).

This record distinguishes real application checks from unit tests, protocol fixtures,
and platform limitations. A passing check applies to the tested build and scenario;
it does not prove the absence of all defects. The accompanying
[security audit](security-audit-2026-09-19.md) records the original security findings.

All runtime accounts, messages, databases, files, federation keys, and services used
here are disposable fixtures on loopback. Native microphone/speaker tests use private
virtual audio devices. Existing user instances, profiles, files, and physical audio
devices are not test inputs.

## Completed suite totals

- Initial security audit: 1,675 Rust tests passed, four environment-specific cases ignored;
  the three GPU cases and private system-audio case were subsequently exercised successfully.
- Client unit suite before the latest release fixes: 2,751 tests passed in 284 files.
- Mocked browser suite: 92 tests passed.
- Production messaging and attachment confidentiality: six real browser cases passed.
- Full PostgreSQL API integration suite: 615 tests across 64 targets passed.
- Real backend release scripts: 16 suites passed, plus installer, migration, recovery,
  database query-plan and PostgreSQL concurrent-session checks.
- Client contracts, bot SDK tests/build, static accessibility, token and contrast checks passed.
- Final complete Rust/client/CI gates will replace these intermediate totals after all fixes settle.

## Build and evidence identity

The tested intermediate release server SHA-256 is
`16176e58ad0fe7bbad126d4234a036832968f10ec59e08d270dd686595a4216e`.
Later topology, quota, gateway, and embedded-client changes require a new final build.
Local packages created during diagnosis carry the previous 3.0.0 version and are **not**
release deliverables.

Evidence is retained outside the repository at `/tmp/mercury-release-20260919/` in
`root`, `authz`, `federation`, and `media` directories. Logs and manifests identify
commands, fixture scope, executable hashes, screenshots, results, and failures.
Earlier security evidence is at
`/tmp/mercury-security-audit-2026-09-19-i778h33b/evidence/`.

The CachyOS host's bundled linuxdeploy strip tool does not understand newer RELR
sections. Local bundling succeeded with `NO_STRIP=1`; this retains symbols and does
not remove any codec feature. Final Linux artifacts need the workflow's older
supported build environment, following [Tauri's AppImage guidance](https://tauri.app/distribute/appimage/).

## Release gates still open

1. Complete and repeat the live federation, bot gateway, quota, and native screen scenarios.
2. Resolve the group-message release scope with a secure account-owned implementation.
3. Build final versioned sources and embedded assets; run complete local and cross-platform CI gates.
4. Configure the existing updater signing key, build/verify final artifacts and manifest.
5. Publish only the validated artifacts, with accurate supported-platform and upgrade notes.
