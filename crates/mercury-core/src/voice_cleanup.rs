//! Releasing a voice state the media server no longer backs.
//!
//! A voice state is a claim — "this account is in this room right now" — and
//! every client in the space draws the room's light from it: the here-now
//! count, the occupant tiles, the lobby's "2 in", whether the room is lit at
//! all. An explicit leave retires the claim, and so does the LiveKit
//! `participant_left` webhook on a LiveKit deployment.
//!
//! The native transport had neither. A client that simply *vanished* — tab
//! closed, laptop shut, network gone — never sends a leave, and the relay's own
//! teardown is a media-plane event that never reached the voice state. The
//! gateway's disconnect sweep looked like the missing piece but never ran: it
//! filtered the account's voice states down to ones whose `session_id` equalled
//! the *gateway* session id, and a native call's session id is the media
//! receipt the REST join mints, which never matches. The result was a room that
//! stayed lit with a ghost in it until the server was restarted.
//!
//! This module is that missing piece, in one place, for every transport: ask
//! the relay whether the account still holds the media connection its voice
//! state claims, and if it has genuinely let go, retire the claim and tell the
//! space.
