//! Regression coverage for event-bus session-id ownership.
//!
//! The session-id keyspace is shared by the WebSocket gateway and the SSE
//! transport, and ids are disclosed to co-members (READY publishes every visible
//! voice state's `session_id`). `register_session` used to be a blind
//! `sessions.insert`, so anyone who learned another user's id could re-point it
//! at their own receiver — and because `user_sessions` still listed the id under
//! the original owner, the victim's user-targeted events (DM `MESSAGE_CREATE`
//! included) were then delivered to the claimant.
