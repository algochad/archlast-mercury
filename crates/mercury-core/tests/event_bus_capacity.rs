//! The per-session event queue is a memory bound, not just a tuning knob.
//!
//! `EventBus::register_session` creates one `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel per
//! gateway connection, and that channel allocates its entire ring up front.
//! Measured on this `ServerEvent` (80 bytes) each slot costs ~105 bytes, so the
//! depth multiplies straight into resident memory at the gateway's connection
//! cap:
//!
//! | depth | per session | at 2000 connections |
//! |-------|-------------|---------------------|
//! | 4096  | ~420 KiB    | ~840 MB             |
//! | 1024  | ~104 KiB    | ~208 MB             |
//!
//! That is allocated whether or not a single event is ever queued, which is why
//! the default is bounded here rather than left at the broadcast channel's
//! historical 4096.
