//! Availability regressions for the two environmental multipliers: a request
//! that runs forever, and a pool wait that queues forever.
//!
//! Neither had a bound. A handler holds its database connection for as long as
//! it is querying, so with no request timeout and sqlx's 30s default acquire
//! timeout a slow request occupied a pool slot to completion while everything
//! behind it queued. Both tests reproduce that by holding the test pool's only
//! connection, which is the same starvation an attacker manufactures by
//! occupying every slot.
//!
//! Every test in this file drives a router built with a deliberately short
//! request timeout (`PARACORD_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`) so the bound can be
//! observed without waiting out the 30s production default.
