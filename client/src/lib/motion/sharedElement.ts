/**
 * "The thing you click becomes the thing you look at" (§5.1).
 *
 * Navigating into a room, a thread, a settings section or a dialog moves ONE
 * shared element from where it was to where it will be, and the chrome that
 * supports it rises 80ms later, staggered. Two engines, one choreography:
 *
 *   - **View Transitions** where the webview has `document.startViewTransition`
 *     (Chromium ≥ 111, WebKit ≥ 18): each participant is given a
 *     `view-transition-name` for the length of the transition and the browser
 *     tweens it, driven by the same `--duration-move` and spring easing.
 *   - **FLIP** everywhere else: measure before, let the update run, measure
 *     after, and play the delta back with Web Animations on transform only.
 *
 * Participants opt in by marking the element on BOTH sides of the update:
 *
 *     <div data-motion-shared="room:2001">…
 *
 * Supporting chrome opts in with `data-motion-chrome`. Under reduced motion the
 * update simply runs.
