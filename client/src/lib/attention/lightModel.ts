/**
 * The light vocabulary, as data (docs/lantern-stage-spec.md §0, §1.2, §1.5).
 *
 * Archlast Mercury is a building at night, and light means people. This module is the
 * single place the three models are written down:
 *
 *   - {@link RoomLight}   — one window: dark, white (talking) or amber (reading).
 *   - {@link PersonLight} — one person: lights on, dim, or off.
 *   - {@link BuildingLight} — one building: the window map, the counts, the
 *     one-sentence "Around now" summary.
 *
 * Pure types and constants only — NO store, React or DOM imports. The builders
 * live next door (`personLight.ts`, `roomLight.ts`, `buildingLight.ts`) and are
 * wired to the stores by `src/hooks/useLights.ts`.
 *
 * Two rules the types exist to enforce (§0):
 *   1. **Every glow has a source.** A `level` other than `dark` always carries
 *      the occupants or readers that caused it. There is no way to construct a
 *      lit room with nobody in it.
 *   2. **Light is never the only cue** (§9). Every model carries a `caption`
 *      string that a component must render somewhere a screen reader can reach.
