 * The product says "server", "channel" and "instance".

 * say `guild` — that is a wire word and it is fine. What is not fine is a
 * SECOND user-facing name for the same object: the shell used to say "building"
 * and "room" while the Connect screen said "server" for the host, so a reader
 * had to guess which of two things a sentence meant, and did.
 *
 * This test reads the source and fails on the retired words in anything a
 * person can read — string literals and JSX text — with an allow-list for each
 * word's other, legitimate meanings (a gap, the space bar, room to breathe).
