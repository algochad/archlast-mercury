/**
 * Why the user is looking at a sign-in screen they did not ask for.
 *
 * A session can end under the user mid-sentence — the server revoked it, an
 * admin signed every device out, the refresh token expired. Archlast Mercury used to
 * answer that by emptying itself: "Unknown user", no buildings, a red
 * "Connection lost — retrying automatically" bar above a shell retrying a
 * refresh that would never succeed. The app knew exactly what had happened and
 * said none of it.
 *
 * Whoever tears a session down records the reason here; the sign-in screen
 * reads it once and says it. It is kept in `sessionStorage` so a reload on the
 * way to the login route does not lose the sentence, and it carries no
 * credential — only a message meant for a human.
