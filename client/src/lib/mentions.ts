/**
 * Mention helpers shared by the gateway dispatch path and the message feed.
 *
 * `mention_everyone` is typed as a required boolean, but no Archlast Mercury server
 * actually emits the field — `build_message_json` never sets it. Reading it
 * directly therefore evaluated to `undefined` on every real message, which is
 * why @everyone highlighting and @everyone mention badges never fired for
 * anyone. Derive the value from the content whenever the field is absent.
 *
 * An explicit `false` from a server that *does* compute the flag is still
 * honoured: that server may have deliberately stripped the ping because the
 * author lacked MENTION_EVERYONE, and the client must not override it.
