/**
 * The themes, in one place.
 *
 * `data-theme` on <html> is the whole mechanism (docs/lantern-stage-spec.md
 * §1.7): every surface, ink, shadow, glow and ring for a theme is declared in
 * `src/styles/tokens.css` under `:root[data-theme=…]`, so a colour is written
 * down exactly once. What this module owns is the *list* — which ids exist,
 * which of them are light, which are looks, and how a message row is shaped —
 * because that list used to be a hand-written union repeated in the store, the
 * hook, the settings screen, the picker and the smoke test, and adding a theme
 * meant finding all five.
 *
 * A **look** is a complete palette rather than a theme plus the user's choices:
 * it brings its own accent and its own ground, so the accent presets and the
 * base-colour control do not apply while one is active. `useTheme` removes the
 * inline properties for those two controls instead of writing them, which is
 * what lets the look's own `tokens.css` block win.
