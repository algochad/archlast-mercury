/**
 * One session refresh in flight per credential, ever.
 *
 * The server rotates the refresh token on every `/auth/refresh` and detects
 * reuse: presenting a token that has already been spent is indistinguishable
 * from theft, so it revokes **every** session the account has. That is the
 * correct response to theft and a catastrophic response to a race.
 *
 * Archlast Mercury used to race itself. Four call sites refreshed the *same* home
 * credential on their own — the legacy `apiClient` singleton, the per-server
 * axios instance built by `createApiClient()` (one per connection, each with
 * its own guard), `connectionManager.refreshServerSession()`, and session
 * bootstrap. Each had, at best, a single-flight guard scoped to itself, which
 * is no guard at all when the credential is shared: one navigation past the
 * access-token expiry fired three or four concurrent refreshes, the first
 * rotated the token, the rest presented the spent one, and the account was
 * signed out mid-use with no message. That is this module's whole reason to
 * exist.
 *
 * Every refresh of a given credential must go through {@link coordinateRefresh}
 * with the same scope key. Callers get the result — access token and rotated
 * refresh token — and apply it to their own store, so a caller that merely
 * joined someone else's flight still ends up holding the fresh credential.

/**
 * How long a settled refresh answers for later callers.
 *
 * A burst of requests does not 401 simultaneously — they land over tens of
 * milliseconds, and the stragglers reach their interceptor after the winner's
 * refresh has already resolved and cleared the in-flight slot. Without this
 * window each straggler starts its own rotation: not a reuse (the previous one
 * finished) but still a needless burst of `/auth/refresh` against the server,
 * and a wider window for the next race. A freshly minted access token is good
 * for minutes, so handing the same one to everyone who asks within a couple of
 * seconds is always correct.
 *
 * Failures are cached for the same window for the same reason: once the server
 * has said "this session is gone", twenty more requests asking again in the
 * same second learn nothing and cost the user twenty error log lines.
