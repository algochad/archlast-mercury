/**
 * D8. The desktop shell's Content-Security-Policy allowed images from `https:`
 * but not `http:`, and that was the first thing anyone noticed about the
 * broken avatars: Archlast Mercury is self-hosted, a self-hosted server on a LAN is
 * routinely plain HTTP, and the webview's page origin is `tauri://localhost`,
 * so every avatar and custom emoji is a cross-origin load at the user's own
 * server. Adding `http:` did make the request leave the process.
 *
 * It is not the fix, and this file exists to stop anyone re-applying it. Even
 * with the scheme allowed, a bare webview image load cannot authenticate
 * (no header, no cookie) and cannot complete at all against a self-signed
 * certificate, which is the ordinary self-hosted case — the certificate pin
 * that makes such a server trustworthy lives in the native client, and the
 * webview's TLS stack has never heard of it. So these images are fetched over
 * the native bridge and handed to the page as `blob:`, and the policy can stay
 * exactly as tight as it was.
