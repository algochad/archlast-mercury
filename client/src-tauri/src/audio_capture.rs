// Consent model for system-audio capture (CWE-862/CWE-359)
//
// Capturing system audio records every other application on the machine and
// puts it in a call, so it needs a grant the webview cannot forge. Where that
// grant comes from differs by platform, and neither route asks again on every
// stream:
//
//   Linux: the grant IS the desktop portal. Screen audio is only ever captured
//     as part of a screen share, and a screen share starts by answering the
//     xdg-desktop-portal picker — an out-of-process, compositor-owned surface a
//     compromised renderer can neither fake nor auto-approve. Paracord used to
//     put a second zenity/kdialog confirmation on top of that; it was redundant,
//     it asked again every single stream, and on a Wayland session the helper
//     inherited display state it could not use, died with "Error 71 (Protocol
//     error)" before anyone saw it, and its non-zero exit was read as "the user
//     said no" (2026-09-14: "System audio capture was denied at the native
//     confirmation prompt", 1.55s after the click, nobody asked). It is gone.
//
//   Windows: there is no portal. The Process Loopback Exclusion API hands us
//     every other process's audio with no OS-level prompt at all, so Paracord
//     asks once per install and remembers the answer on disk
//     (`windows_grant::ensure`). Settings -> Voice & video revokes it.
//
// `SYSTEM_AUDIO_CAPTURE_ENABLED` below is NOT part of that boundary: the
// renderer flips it over IPC and an XSS could do the same. It only says
// "a stream wants audio", and on Windows the persisted grant is checked
// independently before any capture begins.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// NOT a Tauri command. It used to carry `#[tauri::command]` and was never
/// registered in `generate_handler!`, so the only caller that ever invoked it
/// from the renderer got "command not found". System audio is driven entirely
